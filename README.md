A Bukkit/Spigot plugin that enables server operators to control the chats, movements, commands and inventories of other players.

#-What is it?-

iControlU is a popular Minecraft trolling plugin that aims to add mind control to your server. With iCU, players with permission are able to control the chats, movements and inventories of others! Popularized by YouTube celebrities like ZexyZek, iControlU is a fun and unique way to troll your players.

When a player begins controlling someone else, they essentially override all of their target's game input in real-time. Controllers can chat as their target, modify their target's inventory, run commands as their target, and more! Plus, thanks to iCU's use of player disguises, the controller appears as their target to everyone else online - spoofing player movements. iControlU is incredibly fun and easy to use, enabling every server admin to troll at the next level!

#-Using iControlU-

iControlU is extremely easy to use and requires absolutely no setup or configuration. To begin, run the command /icu control <player>. You will immediately begin overriding your target's chats, movements, and inventory, while they watch helplessly behind you. Meanwhile, you yourself are hidden from other players, so your actions are completely unnoticed. Feel free to impersonate them in chat, grief or modify their house, change their inventory, and more! When you're finished with your trickery, simply run /icu stop to exit Control Mode and return your target to normal.

Because iControlU thinks of the troller first, you are given 10 seconds of invisibility after running /icu stop so you can make a hasty escape. Being invisible means that observing players will never know that you were controlling your target!

Every server admin loves having a little trolling fun, and with iControlU, now you can troll at the next level! Install iCU today, for free!
